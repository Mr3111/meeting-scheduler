# Meeting scheduler 

> Use this app to schedule meetings. It internally  uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend. 

## [Live Demo!](https://meeting-scheduler-3111.vercel.app/)

This is a meeting scheduler app. It contains 2 modes:
1. **Normal** - Create a meeting and see all meetings.
2. **Admin** - Create meeting rooms in different buildings.

Note: This backend resets automatically after some time.
